// Freak Fortress 2
// ================
//
// The Administrator
// Class: Spy
// Script: EP
// Model: Dafini
//
// HP: Low (~84%)
// Speed: Normal
// Attack: Knife
// Superjump: None
// Skill: Persuasion (<5 dead players spawn on her side)
// Rage: Coercion (gives Admin a powerful revolver, teleports)
// Rage HP trigger: 2750HP
// 
// Description:
// RED Demo and BLU Soldier made up their differences and became friends again...and they talked about their common employer. Now there is no way for the Administrator to solve this but to murder every single mercenary on her own.
// 
// CHANGELOG:
// ----------
// v1.01 (30 May 2012): Changed charge time to 90 seconds cooldown, 5 seconds warmup; lowered HP to ~74%, lowered speed to 335 units, gave 4 ammo instead of 6
