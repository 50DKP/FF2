// Freak Fortress 2
// ================
//
// The Administrator
// Class: Spy
// Script: EP
// Model: Dafini
//
// HP: Low (~74%)
// Speed: Normal
// Attack: Knife
// Superjump: None
// Skill: Persuasion (<5 dead players spawn on her side)
// Rage: Coercion (gives Admin a powerful revolver, teleports)
// Rage HP trigger: 2750HP
// 
// Description:
// RED Demo and BLU Soldier made up their differences and became friends again...and they talked about their common employer. Now there is no way for the Administrator to solve this but to murder every single mercenary on her own.
// 
// Boss Notes:
// Administrator can pull some mean punches with her rage and especially summon ability. As minions will have full loadouts and ammo upon summon, it is possible to have friendly Engie nests and Medic trains that will make survival for enemies later in the round very painful.
//
// The Rage works similarly as Gentlespy's. While it isn't an instant-kill railgun, Amby Spies will feel right at home with this weapon and its headshot capabilities. It is somewhat weaker than other rages, so this is where the summons come in to provide extra firepower.
//
// Admin players are advised to kill as many as they can and start summoning if HP begins to run out sooner than expected or when support is necessary; use this more actively in the late-game when fewer enemies are around, promoting the survival of summons. For vs. Admin strategy - sirens go off when summoning occurs; be sure to kill them quickly, especially in the case of Engies, Spies, and Medics on their side.
//
// CHANGELOG:
// ----------
// v1.1a (14 June 2012):
// - Fixed the materials issues with the model (no more floating head admin \o/)
// - Updated to Otokiru v1.2
// - Removed Otokiru inclusion in the files - you will have to get this separately (this is to expedite updates and compatibility with future bosses)
// - Changed att. 288 (cannot be crit-boosted) to 15 (no random crits)
// - Added boss notes
// v1.1 (10 June 2012): 
// - Updated to Otokiru v1.1 (which was causing problems with summoning if bosses that used Otokiru were also there)
// - Fixed ammo bug but removed penetration shot (the attribute was causing the bug)
// - Updated skin to purple to aid visibility
// - Gave a 1.5s Über on teleport for vulnerability reduction
// v1.01a (31 May 2012, private): Fixed damage penalty attribute to damage bonus - damage however is still 35% buffed
// v1.01 (30 May 2012): Changed charge time to 90 seconds cooldown, 5 seconds warmup; lowered HP to ~74%, lowered speed to 335 units, gave 4 ammo instead of 6
